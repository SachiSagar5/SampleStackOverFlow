Commit Code: Git Tips
Git is a little different than CVS, every person has a copy of the repository on their local machine. So you can commit to it as much as you like. No build will be triggered.

Most of the built in aliases for git will help because they are similar to CVS.

git pull This will pull a fresh copy of the repository.
git commit This will commit changes to your local repository (not the server).
git add This is a little different, you use git add to add a file to the commit index. It's not just for new files.
git push This is what moves your local repository to the server you checked out from.
git status Shows you the status of your repository.
git diff Gives you a diff of the file.
git rm This lets you remove files and directories.
